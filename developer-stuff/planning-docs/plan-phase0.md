# **Concierge App Development Roadmap: Version 1**

This document outlines the phased development plan for the personalized concierge mobile web application, leveraging a modern, managed service-oriented architecture. The goal is to deliver a bespoke AI-driven experience, starting with a focused music curation use case.

## **Phase 0: Foundation & "Hello World" (Core Loop MVP) \- Detailed Implementation Plan**

**Objective:** To establish the fundamental technical infrastructure and demonstrate the core AI-driven, hybrid conversational-visual user interface. This phase aims to prove the integration of the chosen stack (Vercel, Railway, Supabase) by completing a minimal, end-to-end user interaction.

**Key Features to Deliver:**

* A basic Progressive Web App (PWA) accessible via a web browser.  
* A core chat interface where users can type messages and receive AI responses.  
* The AI will initiate a simple "Hello World" conversation sequence.  
* **Contextual Input Module (Solemn Process):** The AI will dynamically present a structured input form (e.g., for collecting the user's name) directly within the chat area. This input will demand user attention, preventing other chat interactions until completed.  
* **Sideboard Display:** The AI will dynamically place a simple welcome message or a basic visualization into the dedicated Sideboard panel.  
* **Collapsible Exchange Unit:** The entire "Hello World" conversation, including any associated input modules and Sideboard displays, will be grouped and displayed as a single, collapsible unit in the chat history.

#### **A. Cloud Service Provisioning & Initial Setup (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

1. **Supabase Project Provisioning (Database & Authentication):**  
   * Go to Supabase.com and create a new account/project.  
   * Note your Supabase Project URL and Public API Key (often referred to as the anon key).  
   * Navigate to the "Authentication" section in your Supabase project and enable "Email/Password" sign-up method.  
   * *(Quality: Familiarize yourself with Supabase's dashboard and documentation. Ensure proper region selection for your project to minimize latency.)*  
2. **Railway Project Provisioning (FastAPI Backend Hosting):**  
   * Go to Railway.app and create a new account/project.  
   * Prepare your FastAPI backend code in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).  
   * Connect this Git repository to your new Railway project for automatic deployments.  
   * In Railway's project settings, configure Environment Variables:  
     * SUPABASE\_URL (your Supabase Project URL)  
     * SUPABASE\_KEY (your Supabase Public API Key)  
     * LLM\_API\_KEY (your API key for Groq/OpenAI)  
   * *(Robustness: Understand Railway's build logs and deployment process. Ensure environment variables are correctly set and not exposed publicly.)*  
3. **Vercel Project Provisioning (Nuxt.js Frontend Hosting):**  
   * Go to Vercel.com and create a new account/project.  
   * Prepare your Nuxt.js frontend code in a separate Git repository.  
   * Connect this Git repository to your new Vercel project for automatic deployments.  
   * In Vercel's project settings, configure Environment Variables:  
     * VUE\_APP\_FASTAPI\_URL (the URL provided by Railway for your FastAPI backend)  
     * VUE\_APP\_SUPABASE\_URL (your Supabase Project URL)  
     * VUE\_APP\_SUPABASE\_KEY (your Supabase Public API Key)  
   * *(Quality: Verify Vercel's build settings for Nuxt.js. Ensure all necessary environment variables are passed correctly to the frontend build process.)*

#### **B. Backend Development (FastAPI & CrewAI) (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

1. **FastAPI Project Initialization:**  
   * Create a new Python project directory (e.g., backend/).  
   * Initialize a FastAPI application (e.g., in main.py).  
   * Create a requirements.txt file listing core dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, python-dotenv, crewai, openai (or groq).  
   * Ensure your .env file correctly loads the environment variables (Supabase/LLM keys).  
   * *(Robustness: Use pydantic for request body validation in FastAPI. Set up basic logging to monitor API calls and CrewAI agent activity.)*  
2. **Database Connection (Supabase PostgreSQL):**  
   * Install the supabase-py client library: pip install supabase-py.  
   * In your FastAPI application, initialize the Supabase client using your project URL and public key.  
   * *(Quality: Implement connection pooling if necessary for performance. Handle potential database connection errors gracefully.)*  
3. **Supabase Auth Integration (Basic):**  
   * Use supabase-py client in FastAPI for backend interactions with Supabase Auth (e.g., fetching user details after authentication).  
   * *(Security: Understand the difference between the anon key (public, client-side) and service\_role key (private, server-side). Only use the service\_role key in your backend for privileged operations.)*  
4. **CrewAI Core Setup & Agent Definition:**  
   * Install crewai and your chosen LLM client (openai or groq) in your Python environment.  
   * Configure the LLM provider within your FastAPI app, ensuring it uses the API key retrieved from environment variables.  
   * **Define** GreetingAgent**:**  
     * **Role:** "The primary greeter and initial guide."  
     * **Goal:** "To warmly welcome the user, introduce the app's functionality, and obtain their basic identity (name) to personalize the interaction."  
     * **Tasks:**  
       * greet\_user\_and\_ask\_name: Formulate a welcoming message and then instruct the UI to present a name input module.  
       * process\_name\_and\_welcome: Receive the user's name from the input module, acknowledge it, and instruct the UI to display a welcome message in the Sideboard.  
     * **Tools:**  
       * ContextualInputModuleTool: An internal tool (implemented as a Python function in your FastAPI app) that sends a specific JSON payload to the frontend, instructing it to display a Contextual Input Module (e.g., a text field for a name).  
       * SideboardDisplayTool: An internal tool that sends a JSON payload to the frontend, instructing it to display content in the Sideboard.  
   * *(Intelligence: Craft concise and effective LLM prompts for the GreetingAgent to ensure clear communication and correct intent recognition for a "Hello World" scenario. Implement basic retry logic for LLM API calls.)*  
5. **FastAPI Endpoints for "Hello World":**  
   * POST /api/chat**:**  
     * Receives user's chat messages (e.g., { "message": "..." }).  
     * Passes the message to the GreetingAgent (CrewAI) for processing.  
     * Receives the agent's conversational response and returns it to the frontend.  
   * POST /api/ui/component-trigger**:**  
     * This is a crucial internal endpoint. When a CrewAI agent uses a tool like ContextualInputModuleTool or SideboardDisplayTool, these tools will internally call *this* FastAPI endpoint.  
     * The endpoint will receive a structured payload (e.g., { "component\_type": "name\_input\_form", "data": { "label": "Your First Name" } }).  
     * It then relays this payload to the frontend, instructing it *which* UI component to render dynamically.  
   * POST /api/submit-name**:**  
     * Receives the structured data (e.g., { "name": "John" }) submitted by the Contextual Input Module on the frontend.  
     * Passes this data back to the GreetingAgent (CrewAI) for further processing (e.g., acknowledgment, triggering the Sideboard welcome).  
   * *(Robustness: Implement basic input validation for all incoming API requests. Ensure consistent JSON response formats for both success and error cases.)*

#### **C. Frontend Development (Vue/Nuxt.js PWA) (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

1. **Nuxt.js Project Initialization & PWA Setup:**  
   * Create a new Nuxt.js project directory (e.g., frontend/).  
   * Configure nuxt.config.ts for basic PWA features (manifest, service worker registration).  
   * *(Quality: Ensure proper meta tags for PWA installation prompts on mobile devices. Consider a basic loading state for the app while initial data is fetched.)*  
2. **Supabase Client Setup:**  
   * Install the Supabase JS client library.  
   * Initialize the Supabase client in your Nuxt.js app using your project URL and Public API Key (from Vercel environment variables).  
   * *(Robustness: Handle Supabase client initialization errors gracefully. Ensure API keys are correctly loaded from environment variables.)*  
3. **Core UI Components:**  
   * **Chat UI Component:**  
     * A central Vue component to display chat messages (distinguishing AI vs. User).  
     * Includes a text input field and a "Send" button.  
     * Implements API calls to the POST /api/chat endpoint on your Railway-hosted backend.  
     * *(UX: Design clear chat bubble styles. Implement auto-scrolling to the latest message. Consider basic message formatting.)*  
   * **Sideboard UI Component:**  
     * A Vue component representing the collapsible Sideboard panel.  
     * Includes an active-display-area to show dynamic content.  
     * Will eventually contain a "Sideboard History" (initially empty for Phase 0).  
     * *(Quality: Ensure smooth CSS transitions for expanding/collapsing. The Sideboard should be responsive and occupy appropriate screen real estate on various devices.)*  
   * **Contextual Input Module Component:**  
     * A generic Vue component capable of dynamically rendering various form elements based on the data received from the backend.  
     * For "Hello World," it will be configured to render a simple text input field for the user's name.  
     * It implements the "solemn process" behavior: overlaying the main chat input, disabling other chat interactions, and having explicit "Save" and "Cancel" buttons.  
     * Sends submitted data to the appropriate backend endpoint (e.g., POST /api/submit-name).  
     * *(Robustness: Implement client-side validation for input modules (e.g., name not empty). Ensure all user interactions are captured and sent correctly to the backend.)*  
4. **Dynamic UI Rendering Logic:**  
   * Implement the core logic within your main frontend component to listen for incoming API responses from the FastAPI backend.  
   * If a response contains a component\_type (e.g., name\_input\_form, sideboard\_welcome\_display), dynamically render the corresponding Vue component (Contextual Input Module or Sideboard content) with the provided data payload.  
   * *(Intelligence: This logic will become the core of your hybrid UI. Design it to be extensible for future component types. Handle cases where an unknown component type is received gracefully.)*

#### **D. Integration & "Hello World" Flow Execution (Estimated Time: 1 Day)**

1. **Deploy Backend to Railway:**  
   * Push your backend/ code to the connected GitHub repository.  
   * Railway will automatically detect your Dockerfile, build the image, and deploy your FastAPI application to a publicly accessible URL.  
   * Verify the Railway-provided URL works and your initial API endpoints are accessible.  
   * *(Automation: Ensure Railway's build process is robust and handles dependencies correctly. Monitor Railway logs for deployment issues.)*  
2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel:**  
   * Push your frontend/ code to the connected GitHub repository.  
   * Vercel will automatically detect your Nuxt.js project, build the PWA, and deploy it to a publicly accessible URL.  
   * Verify the Vercel-provided URL works.  
   * *(Automation: Check Vercel build logs for any frontend compilation errors. Ensure environment variables are correctly passed during the Vercel build.)*  
3. **Execute "Hello World" User Flow:**  
   * Open the Vercel-provided URL for your PWA in a web browser.  
   * Observe the initial AI greeting message.  
   * Type "Hello" (or any greeting) in the chat and send.  
   * Observe the Contextual Input Module appearing (the solemn process).  
   * Type your name into the input module and click "Save Name".  
   * Observe the input module disappearing, the AI's personalized welcome message in the chat, and the Sideboard expanding to show its welcome content.  
   * Observe that the entire conversation sequence is grouped into a single, collapsible "Exchange Unit" in the chat history.  
   * *(Validation: Conduct thorough manual testing across different browsers and devices to ensure the entire flow works as expected.)*  
4. **Manual Testing:**  
   * Verify the entire flow across Vercel and Railway.  
   * Check network requests in browser developer tools to ensure correct API calls and responses.

#### **E. CI/CD Pipeline (Leveraging Managed Services) (Estimated Time: 1 Day)**

1. **Vercel (Frontend CI/CD):**  
   * This is handled automatically by Vercel. Any git push to your connected frontend repository will trigger a build and deployment to your Vercel project.  
   * *(Efficiency: Leverage Vercel's preview deployments for pull requests to allow easy review of frontend changes before merging to main.)*  
2. **Railway (Backend CI/CD):**  
   * This is handled automatically by Railway. Any git push to your connected backend repository will trigger a build and deployment of your FastAPI application on Railway.  
   * *(Efficiency: Configure Railway to deploy to a staging environment on develop branch pushes and to production on main branch merges, creating clear deployment gates.)*
