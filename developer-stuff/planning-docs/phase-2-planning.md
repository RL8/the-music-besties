# Phase 2 Planning Document - The Music Besties

This document outlines the planning for Phase 2 of The Music Besties application, focusing on social features and enhanced music recommendations.

## Overview

Phase 1 established the core functionality of The Music Besties application, including:
- Conversational UI for music curation

The implementation will be iterative, with regular feedback cycles to ensure we're meeting user needs and expectations. The technical foundation laid in Phase 1 will be extended to support these new features while maintaining performance and security.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize Phase 2.1 technical specifications
2. Create detailed wireframes for new UI components
3. Establish development milestones and sprint planning
4. Begin implementation of database schema updates
